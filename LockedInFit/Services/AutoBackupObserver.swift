/// family now uses (see Social Climber): instead of every mutation site
/// having to remember to call `scheduleBackupSoon`, one observer guarantees a
/// backup follows any change that reaches the store, so a screen that forgets
/// to schedule one can never leave an edit uncaptured. The existing
/// `scheduleBackupSoon` calls at individual mutation sites stay as redundant
/// belt-and-suspenders triggers, on purpose: more than one independent
/// trigger means no single one has to be perfectly reliable.
///
/// Debounced rather than one backup per save, so a burst of saves in quick
/// succession (bulk edits, autosave firing repeatedly) coalesces into a
/// single write via `scheduleBackupSoon`'s own trailing-edge scheduling. The
/// content-hash dedupe inside `performBackup` makes a save that changed
/// nothing observable a cheap no-op.
